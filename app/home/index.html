                    ## Academic work and achievements
                    
                    ### “Graph Comparison”
                    
                    For my graduate project (2018), I implemented several graph similarity algorithms. The algorithms were used in a semantic graph analysis project. The project culminated in an article titled “Comparing Graph Similarity Measures for Semantic Representations of Documents” (Manrique et al., 2018). (Project link, Paper link)
                    
                    ### “Steps Towards a Predictive Semantic Resource Recommendation System for University Students”
                    
                    For my master's thesis (August 2019 - November 2020), I created the underlying systems necessary for the development of a resource recommendation system for university students. The system used machine learning to predict students’ performance in future courses based on their academic history.  In parallel, I developed a system to analyze and connect university courses using semantic information. The project detected a significant correlation between these two systems, which suggests that an important link between 2 branches of Artificial Intelligence (machine learning and semantic networks) exists in academic data. (Thesis link)
                    
                    My master's thesis resulted in 2 academic articles: "Predicting Students' Course Performance Using Classification and Regression Algorithms” (Cueto-ramirez, Marino, Manrique, & Romero, n.d.) (Manuscript) and "Analyzing Feature Importance in a Course Performance Prediction Model by Detecting Semantic Relationships” (Cueto-ramirez, Marino, Manrique, & Bejarano, n.d.) (Manuscript)
                    
                    ## Work Experience
                    
                    ### Digital57 (https://digital57.co/) June 2017-December 2017
                    
                    Data Engineer Intern
                    
                    I was in charge of the internal data management of the company. Among my responsibilities were: sending SMS to appropriate audiences, handling reports, metrics, and data visualizations for internal (employee) and external communication (with customers), supporting the design team with the implementation of tools and solutions for landing pages and emails.
                    
                    Achievements:
                    
                    I designed and developed the Digital57 customer and employee platform. This project involved designing and deploying the server infrastructure on an AWS virtual machine, designing and deploying a web page using REACT, and designing and deploying the Java back-end with a MySQL database.
                    
                    ### University of Los Andes (https://uniandes.edu.co/) August 2018-August 2020
                    
                    Graduate Assistant
                    
                    Assistant to the director of the Masters in Science in Systems and Computing Engineering program with various support responsibilities including: monitoring meetings of the administrative board of the program, data analysis, and data collection platform development.
                    
                    Achievements:
                    
                    I designed and developed a system for handling Cursera course file information. This system allowed course resources to be tagged with semantic tags connected to Dbpedia.
                    
                    ### WebGameFramework December 2020-May 2021
                    
                    Full Stack Developer
                    
                    As a personal project, I developed a framework which allows developers to create web games using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript game development using web tools. The framework avoids using the HTML canvas tool to ensure that games can use HTML, CSS, and JavaScript libraries to enhance the users experience.
                    
                    Achievements:
                    
                    A game system compatible with a wide variety of tools and web libraries. A web tool that optimizes server costs by compressing transferred resources into zip files. An execution environment with high security to prevent possible attacks on the end user.

                    ### Hummingbirds AI (https://hummingbirds.ai/) June 2021-Present
                    
                    Back End Developer
                    
                    Although my official title working for Hummingbirds is Back End developer, I’d argue that my duties have been expanded to Full Stack developer since being hired. At Hummingbirds I’ve worked on two windows applications which integrate AI systems to improve user security and user privacy.
                    
                    GuacamoleCX was an application meant to improve security at call-centers. The app used 2 cameras, birds eye view camera, and a front facing camera to monitor a users actions, and record any suspicious activity for later inspection. The app was developed using Python, and was connected to a python backend and a REACT frontend.
                    
                    GuacamoleID is an application designed to run continuous face matching on your desktop computer. As soon as you walk away, the system 	automatically blocks your computer screen to protect your privacy. And as soon as you come back to your PC, the system automatically 	recognizes you, and unblocks your PC. We developed a prototype with python, and a production app with C++/QT.
                    
                    Achievements:
                    
                    Integrated computer vision code to a GUI interface. Managed communication between a native application and a remote server to handle a user login, an app heartbeat, and secure video transfers. Managed complex dynamic inter-thread communication.
